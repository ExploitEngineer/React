1. What is React ?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is a declarative, component-based library developed by Meta (Facebook) that helps developers build complex, interactive, and fast UIs using a virtual DOM and stateful components.


2. Why Use React ?
. Scalable for large apps
. Reusable components
. Huge community and ecosystem
. Performance via Virtual DOM
. Offical support for React Native (mobile apps)


3. SPA (Single Page Application) Concept
SPA is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content on the page without reloading it, as the user interacts with the app.
In Simpler Terms:
. You load the app once.
. After that, navigation and content updates happen via JavaScript - not full page reloads.
. Everything happens in a single page (index.html) using AJAX or fetch, DOM updates, and client-side routing.


4. What is JSX ?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like.
It allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript.


5. What is a Fragment in React ?
In React, Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
Normally, a React component must return a single parent element. But what if you don't want unnecessary <div>'s wrapping everything ?
That's where fragments come in.


6. What is a Class Component ?
A Class Component is an ES6 class that extends React.Component and must define a render() method that returns JSX.
