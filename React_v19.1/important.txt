1. What are CLI Tools in React Projects ?
CLI (Command Line Interface) tools help automate project setup and development workflows.
When building React apps, you can either:
- Set up everything manually (Webpack, Babel, React, etc.)
- Or use a CLI tool to scaffold all of that for you (e.g., Vite, Create React App).

2. What is Vite ?
Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides:
- Fast startup using native ES modules (no bundling at dev time)
- Lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Optimized production build using Rollup
- First-class support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules, etc.
- Plugin ecosystem similar to Rollup/Vite itself

3. How Vite works under the hood ?
- Uses native ESM (ES Modules) in the browser.
- Doesn't bundle - instead, it serves files direcly.
- When a file changes, only that module is reloaded -> super fast HMR.
Build Mode:
- Uses Rollup to bundle the app efficiently
- Tree-shakes, splits code, minifies for production

4. Creating a React App with Vite
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn or pnpm

npm create vite@latest my-react-app

5. What is Webpack ?
Webpack is a module bundler. Its job is to bundle your javascript code and assets (CSS, Images, Fonts, etc.) into optimized files for the browser.
Think of it like this: 
        Webpack takes your entire React project (JSX, CSS, Images), understands all the imports, and builds a final set of files that can run in a browser.

6. What are component in React ?
A component in React is a reusable, independent piece of UI that can manage its own state and logic.
You can think of a component as a function or class that returns JSX (HTML + JS combined).

7. What is JSX ?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for javascript that looks like HTML, and it's used to describe what the UI should look like in React. It lets you write UI elements in a familiar, HTML-like way inside javascript code.

8. What is Composition in React ?
Composition is the pattern of building complex UIs by combining smaller reusable components - like assembling Lego blocks.
Instead of Inheritance (Like in OOP), React Favors composition to structure logic and UI.

9. What is Component LifeCycle in React ?
The lifecycle of a React component refers to the stages a component goes through from when it is created, displayed, updated, and removed from the DOM.
Mount (appear) -> Update (change) -> Unmount (disappear)

10. ðŸŽ­ What is Render Props in React ?
Render Props is a pattern where a component accepts a function as a prop and calls it to render UI dynamically.
This allows you to share logic between components while letting the consumer decide what to render.

11. What is Zustand ?
Zustand is a small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy api based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.
Zustand is often used as an alternative to other state management libraries, such as Redux and MobX, because of its simplicity and small size. It is particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized applications, where the complexity of large state management libraries is not required.
