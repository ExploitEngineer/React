1. What are CLI Tools in React Projects ?
CLI (Command Line Interface) tools help automate project setup and development workflows.
When building React apps, you can either:
- Set up everything manually (Webpack, Babel, React, etc.)
- Or use a CLI tool to scaffold all of that for you (e.g., Vite, Create React App).

2. What is Vite ?
Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides:
- Fast startup using native ES modules (no bundling at dev time)
- Lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Optimized production build using Rollup
- First-class support for TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules, etc.
- Plugin ecosystem similar to Rollup/Vite itself

3. How Vite works under the hood ?
- Uses native ESM (ES Modules) in the browser.
- Doesn't bundle - instead, it serves files direcly.
- When a file changes, only that module is reloaded -> super fast HMR.
Build Mode:
- Uses Rollup to bundle the app efficiently
- Tree-shakes, splits code, minifies for production

4. Creating a React App with Vite
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have:
- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn or pnpm

npm create vite@latest my-react-app

5. What is Webpack ?
Webpack is a module bundler. Its job is to bundle your javascript code and assets (CSS, Images, Fonts, etc.) into optimized files for the browser.
Think of it like this: 
        Webpack takes your entire React project (JSX, CSS, Images), understands all the imports, and builds a final set of files that can run in a browser.

6. What are component in React ?
A component in React is a reusable, independent piece of UI that can manage its own state and logic.
You can think of a component as a function or class that returns JSX (HTML + JS combined).

7. What is JSX ?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for javascript that looks like HTML, and it's used to describe what the UI should look like in React. It lets you write UI elements in a familiar, HTML-like way inside javascript code.
