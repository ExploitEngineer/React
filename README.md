# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some essential ESLint rules for linting.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project on your local machine using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later recommended).
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js) or yarn.

### Steps to Install and Run
```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ExploitEngineer/React.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
$ cd React

# Step 3: Install dependencies using npm or yarn
$ npm install
# OR
$ yarn install

# Step 4: Start the development server
$ npm run dev
# OR
$ yarn dev

# Step 5: Open the app in your browser
# Vite will provide you with a local development URL like:
# http://localhost:3000
```

To ensure seamless setup, here is a bash script for quick installation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script to automate the setup process for React + Vite project

# Clone the repository
echo "Cloning the repository..."
git clone https://github.com/ExploitEngineer/React.git

# Navigate to the project directory
echo "Navigating to the project directory..."
cd React || exit

# Install dependencies
echo "Installing dependencies..."
npm install || yarn install

# Start the development server
echo "Starting the development server..."
npm run dev || yarn dev

# Display the local development URL
echo "The application is running at: http://localhost:3000"
```
Save this script in a `.sh` file, make it executable (`chmod +x filename.sh`), and run it for automated setup.

## Scripts
Below are the key npm/yarn scripts you can use:
- **`npm run dev`** or **`yarn dev`**: Start the development server with HMR.
- **`npm run build`** or **`yarn build`**: Build the project for production.
- **`npm run preview`** or **`yarn preview`**: Preview the production build locally.

## How the Counter App Works
The Counter App is a simple yet effective example of React's capabilities. Here is an overview of its key features:

### Increment Button
- Increases the count by 1 when clicked.

### Decrement Button
- Decreases the count by 1 when clicked.

### Reset Button
- Resets the count back to 0, demonstrating how to update state to a predefined value.

The app makes use of React's `useState` hook to manage the count state and re-render the UI dynamically as the state changes.
